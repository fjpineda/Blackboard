Blackboard
=======================

A light-weight stand-alone concurrency control system for perl scripts. 
No additional software (MPI, relational database, etc.) is required. 
Methods in the module monitor and update status files in a 'blackboard' 
directory. A lockfile strategy ensures that only one agent at a time is 
allowed to access the blackboard directory, thereby eliminating race 
conditions.
